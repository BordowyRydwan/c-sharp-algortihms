# Linear search

This algorithm is really simple.
1. Iterate over the array
2. If you find the element, break the loop.

This entry in the repository was made mostly for comparison with binary and ternary search :smile:

int LinearSearch(int[] arr, int element) | index of the searched element | O(n) | O(1) |

## TODO:
- [ ] translate the readme into Polish
- [ ] write unit tests
