# Ternary search

Decent explaination: [HERE](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/ternary-search/). Source: GeeksForGeeks.

Binary search is slightly more efficient than this algorithm, but it's still interesting :smile:

## Methods inside:
Declaration | Type of result | Time complexity | Memory stack size | Notes
------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------
int TernarySearch(int[] arr, int left, int right, int number) | index of the searched element | O(log(n)) | O(1) | if element is not present, algorithm returns -1; input has to be sorted

## TODO:
- [ ] translate the readme into Polish
- [ ] write unit tests
