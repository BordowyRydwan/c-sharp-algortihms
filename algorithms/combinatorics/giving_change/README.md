# Coin change problem

It's a typical example of problem solvable by dynamic programming paradigm. There's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgiZlGzXMBw) by "Back to Back SWE" channel explaining it.


## Methods inside:
Declaration | Type of result | Time complexity | Memory stack size | Notes
------------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|------
int HowManyChangeWays(int[] coins, int change) | ways of giving a change | O(n*m) | O(n) | 
int MinimumChangeCoins(int[] coins, int change) | minimum required coins | O(n) | O(n) |

## TODO:
- [ ] extract the algorithms into separate files.
- [ ] translate the readme into Polish
- [ ] write unit tests
