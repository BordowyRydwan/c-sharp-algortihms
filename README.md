# C# Algorithms

This repo is an extension of ![algorithms-and-data-structures](https://github.com/BordowyRydwan/algorithms-and-data-structures) repo. It contains algorithms from lectures rewritten in quite more understandable way. Feel free to use the code - just remember to read the code that you wanna use - it might e.g. use other data structues than you need.

##  Algorithms

### Algebra

Name | Time complexity | Memory stack size
-----| ----------------| -----------------
Binomial coefficient | O(n) | O(1)
Prime numbers lower than N | O(n^2) | O(n)
Prime test | O(n) | O(1) |
