# Data structures

## Implemented data structures:

- [Tree](tree)
- [Binary tree (linked)](binary_tree)
- [Binary tree (array)](array_binary_tree)
- [Binary search tree](bst) (derives from [linked binary tree](binary_tree))

## To implement:

- Linked list
- Array list
- Sorted list
- Queue
- Heap (deriving from [array binary tree](array_binary_tree))
- Set
